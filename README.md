# Rhino Inside Unity
An ongoing collection of Extension Functions, Utility Scripts and Examples that ease the integration of the RhinoCommon SDK inside the Unity3d game engine.

This project is based on the [Rhino3dmIO Toolkit](https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon/wiki/Rhino3dmIO-Toolkit-(OpenNURBS-build)) by McNeel, which exposes all of the RhinoCommon functionality to external applications, thus enabling Unity users to access the sophisticated geometric functions and data-types present in Rhinoceros3D.

Tested in Unity 2018.3.
